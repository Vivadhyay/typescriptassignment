        <p>The Animal Kingdom is one diverse classification containing thousands of species, with thousands more waiting to be discovered. Each species would differ from the other, in terms of habitat, characteristics, hunting abilities, and much, much more. This diversity can be attributed to evolution â€“ development of different defining characteristics that would set apart the large number of organisms from each other. The Animal Kingdom is truly one big melting pot of diverse beings. This however can be argued upon, for despite the hundreds of differences between the members of the group, there exists many more that would bind them as one.</p>
